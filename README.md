# weather-forecast-prediction
I made a weather forecast predicting model, that basically predicts your local weather with machine learning. 

# Weather Data Analysis

## Project Overview
Analysis of weather patterns using historical data with machine learning predictions. Predicting the Target temp the next day

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing as well as metrics (absolute mean zero)
- Temperature trend analysis
- Predictive modeling with Ridge regression
- Improved prediction by adding own testing variables

## Technologies
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
